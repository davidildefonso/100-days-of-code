### Day 1: January 30, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I've created a new repository for my angular project, it will be a admin app for managing sales and inventory for a small business. I created the angular app and added some components and styles nothing too dificult, also added some tests for some of the components just followinf the examples.

**Thoughts** I think I spent more than an hour coding but most of it was html and css for the components, so far so good
