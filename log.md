### Day 1: January 30, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I've created a new repository for my angular project, it will be a admin app for managing sales and inventory for a small business. I created the angular app and added some components and styles nothing too dificult, also added some tests for some of the components just followinf the examples.

**Thoughts** I think I spent more than an hour coding but most of it was html and css for the components, so far so good

### Day 3: February 2, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to get the data from angular HttpClient (finally!) also found a way to get the URL and next will have to display the data according to the current url, will do this tomorrow

**Thoughts** I took me a long time to get the data from the Httpclient and now I need to present the data based on the url and pass this to all components, need to study more !

### Day 4: February 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I found that *ngFor is very useful to display data in angular I made little improvement today at least I have the data and now I need to pass it from one component to another.

**Thoughts** I didnt have much time today I will make up for this tomorrow, making little steps but Its fine
